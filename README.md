## Purpose

All results from the analysis are displayed below.

Based on the above summary we can conclude the following:

 - Temperatures are slightly higher in the month of June as compared to December.

 - Temperatures in the month of June are more consistent as compared to the ones in December. The min temperature is much lower for December.

 - It seems that we do have slightly more data in the month of June as opposed to December. Based on this we can conclude that the sales for both months would be very similar.

## Summary

Based on the above analysis, we can see that the temparatures are high enough for both June and December. This should allow W. Avy to open the surf shop in both these months.

Here are two additional quesries that we would recommend to gather more info for June and Decemeber:

 1. Get the precipitation data for June and December to get to know how much rain is there for both months.
 2. Get the precipitation data for each station for June and December. This will provide location details on where the most rain was.
